üéì **Personal Side-Project**  
This app is my way of learning how to build a small-scale social network while scratching a real itch: finding _actually_ good movies to watch.  
The best recommendations I ever get come from friends whose taste I trust‚Äîso I‚Äôm wiring that experience into code.  
Expect rough edges, frequent tweaks, and a lot of fun experiments along the way!
